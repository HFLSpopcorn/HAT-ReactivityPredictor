# HAT-ReactivityPredictor
### Demo of reactivity prediction of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction via machine learning

# Requirements

# How to use the model
## Step 1
**Optimization of the structures of reactant and product molecules (substrates and HAT catalysts) and calculation of their property features**

1. Use quantum chemical software, such as Gaussian or Orca, to obtain optimized structures at the level of ***B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)***.
2. Perform single point energy calculation at the level of ***M06-2X/def2tzvpp*** with consideration of solvation energy correction of MeCN using SMD model.
